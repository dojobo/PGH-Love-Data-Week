### <a name="thurs-cmu-1"></a>Data Management for Qualitative Data 
**12-1pm** // hosted by the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries
>Research data management education provides guidance on how researchers can effectively manage their data to increase the scholarly impact from their research. However, guidelines for data management may vary significantly across domain areas. All domain areas engage with data in some manner, with the caveat that the physical form of these data may differ visually and structurally. Researchers specializing in qualitative data engage with many unique forms of data, including photographs, film, literature, ethnographies, and audiovisual materials, all with their own considerations for how to effectively manage them. This workshop will provide data management tips and tips specifically aimed at qualitative researchers from all levels (students, staff, and faculty), including how to clean data, develop file-naming schemes, and store your data securely.

## Monday, 2/14
### <a name="mon-uls-1"></a>Getting Started in R and R Studio (Online)
**12-1pm**, Zoom
>R is a free, open-source software package and programming language for working with data, especially statistical analysis. RStudio is a popular software environment and toolset for using R. In this one-hour, online workshop, we will become oriented within the RStudio environment and explore in a cursory way several common tasks for data work, such as examining and filtering data, generating linear models, and creating simple plots. Participants are welcome to follow along hands-on or merely watch.
>
>Can't make it to this workshop? Check out our other R workshops! You can also always contact us with your questions about this and other data-related topics.

## Thursday, 2/17
### <a name="thurs-uls-1"></a>Data TLC: Organizing Data with Spreadsheets Part 1 (Online)
**12-1pm**, Zoom
>Good data organization is the foundation of any research project. Typically, we organize data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with the data. However, computers require data to be structured in particular ways in order to use tools that make computation and analysis more efficient.
>
>In this workshop, participants will learn  
>
>* Common uses for spreadsheets
>* Good data entry and formatting practices
>* How to avoid common formatting mistakes  
>
>This workshop will not cover data analysis with spreadsheets but will focus on the important initial “data wrangling” stage that enables you to do proper analysis later.

>
>* How to document data for future use
>* Basic quality control and data manipulation in spreadsheets
>* How to export data from spreadsheets

## Friday, 2/18
### <a name="fri-uls-1"></a>Data and Music: Dr. Aaron Myers-Brooks, Pitt Department of Music faculty
**12-1pm**, Hillman Library, G-74 Amy Knapp Rm.
>Electronic Music presents a fascinating opportunity for the mixing and matching of disparate input and output data. My presentation will demonstrate three very different input methods, which will generate three very different sonic results. I will begin with drawings generated in HighC, a piece of software based around 20th century composer Iannis Xenakis’s UPIC program. These drawings will generate synthesized soundscapes. I will then perform an improvised hip-hop beat using a video game controller in conjunction with Ableton Live. Finally, I will demonstrate an excerpt from an in progress piece for microtonal guitar and real time effects processing.

Registration link forthcoming

### <a name="fri-uls-2"></a>Intro to Glitch Art (Online)
**1-2pm**, Zoom
>This online workshop will cover some of the various tools and techniques associated with the creation of Glitch Art. In addition, participants will be introduced to some of the history and conceptual theories surrounding glitch and Glitch Art.
>
>This workshop will use hex editor Notepad++ (PC, make sure to use 32 bit version) or Hex Fiend (Mac) and audio editing software Audacity for data bending. Please download both ahead of time if you want to follow along.

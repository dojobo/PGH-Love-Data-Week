<p><strong>Love Data Week</strong> is an annual time for libraries to showcase, discuss, and celebrate working with data.</p>
<p>2023 is <a href="https://www.yearofemotionalwellbeing.pitt.edu/">the Year of Emotional Well-Being at Pitt</a>, and this year we want to emphasize healthy learning and professional development: it’s not about being the perfect coder or making the perfect plot, but about starting where you are, and doing what you can with what you have.</p>
<p>In that spirit, we’re offering accessible workshops, artistic expressions with data, informative talks, and social mixers about data work.</p>
<p>When is Love Data Week at Pitt? Well, <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/about/cms/3799">International Love Data Week</a> is always the week of Valentine’s Day, but our events at Pitt can’t all fit into one week! Our dates locally are <strong>February 9–17 &amp; 23, 2023.</strong></p>
<p>How to register? There is no registration for the entire series; each event has its own registration link, so pick and choose as you like! All events are free and open to the Pitt and UPMC communities.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Data is collected and shared in a myriad of ways and sometimes can be complicated or difficult to understand (especially in a presentation where the slide goes too quickly and the numbers are small and you are in the back of the room). But there are many ways to use and share data!</p>
<p>Please join us as we explore the connection between art and the creative side of visualizing data. In this workshop we will share data art inspiration, explore resources for personal and civic data, and spend time getting creative making our own art using data.</p>
<p>No computers will be used in this event, and there are no prerequisite skills or experiences. You are encouraged to join even (or especially!) if you feel like you shouldn’t because you aren’t a “data” person. You should!</p>
<p>Through this workshop, we hope you will build connections, discover new ways of displaying data, and feel more confident exploring datasets on your own.</p>

&amp; <strong>Ali Krzton</strong>, Research Data Management Librarian, Auburn University</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For those of us who aren’t data scientists, “data science” can feel mysterious and out of reach. In reality, data science is like everything else – completed in a series of steps, inevitably beginning with the first. Nobody begins anything as an expert – this talk will provide some tools for starting where you are.</p>
<p>Led by two recent data science beginners, this talk will open with an introduction to getting to know your data. Understanding the structure and scope of your data is an essential first step in working with it successfully. We will use an open-source tool called Open Refine to review a data set and understand the many ways in which data can be messy.</p>
<p>Another important step in building data science skills is working from existing code. Far from being a lazy shortcut, code reuse is standard practice in data science. We will share some tips for getting the most out of code samples, including finding reusable code, interpreting functions and adapting existing code to the needs of your project.</p>
<p>Having recently completed data science fellowships, the two presenters each began their fellowship work as newcomers to data science. By the end, each had completed projects that advanced analysis across federal funding and research data management agencies. They did so by starting where they were, taking one step at a time and learning to ask for help when needed. Their talk will conclude with a review of easy-to-access resources available to data workers of all levels of ability.</p>

<p><strong>Dr.&nbsp;Susan Lucas</strong>, Urban Studies</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In this workshop participants will learn about spatial data and nonspatial attribute data, types of spatial data files and thematic maps. Using software developed by Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute), the world leader in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), participants will learn how to produce several types of thematic maps using ArcGIS Online (AGOL) and ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World (Living Atlas). AGOL is a piece of web-based mapping software that allows users to produce a variety interactive web-based thematic maps, perform spatial analyses and visualize data. The Living Atlas of the World is a curated collection of geospatial data from around the world. Easily accessible, the Living Atlas allows individuals to find and manipulate geospatial data using Esri software. Participants will then learn how to open their maps in ArcGIS Pro, a desktop GIS and export maps as a pdf.</p>

<p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are any type of educational material freely available for teachers and students to use, adapt, share, and reuse. These resources can be overwhelming to locate and/or create. This discussion will review a project to compile and share a repository of information for clinician students learning about data. The project began with an OER grant, found an iteration on Google Docs, GitHub Pages, and a Notion repository. This presentation will discuss challenges, learnings, and options to learn along the presenter’s journey and share resources for both health sciences and data science perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>Emmaline Rial</strong> (they/them), MPA Candidate, University of Pittsburgh</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Students have a deep desire to align their education and skills meaningfully to the struggle for social justice they observe or experience in the real world. Organizations have a need for the skills that the students want to offer, however infrastructure is needed to connect the two. For example, students may need help translating issues on the ground into the language of their discipline, design projects that fit into their academic schedule or to find peers and mentors to work together with. This talk will present one example of such an infrastructure at CAASI Grief to Action and show how it was leveraged to create the Allegheny County Policing Project.</p>

<p><strong>Brian Riordan</strong>, School of Music</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Real-time electronic music presents a fascinating opportunity for manipulating data to produce different sonic results. In the past, this genre was created exclusively in the studio. Recently, a floodgate of new hardware interfaces for musical expression gave laptop performers newer and better ways to control software with hardware on stage in front of an audience. Music, at its core, is a means of communication, and computers offer ways of enhancing interconnection. My presentation will demonstrate three real-time approaches to manipulating computer data to produce electronic sounds. I will begin with a demonstration using the laptop as an instrument using the programming environment Max/MSP. Next, I will perform a short improvisation using an iPad as a controller, which uses a custom-built interface. Finally, I will expand the presentation into a group workshop by inviting several audience members to participate with their laptops. By connecting to the wi-fi, the participants can perform electronic music as a group using a URL that I will generate for the workshop.</p>

<p>Working with data can be a love-hate relationship, full of ups and downs, excitement and frustration. Our social mixer will offer an inclusive space to commiserate with other data collectors, analysts, and wranglers, grow your professional network, and swap practical ideas and tips. We welcome those from all stages of learning, from beginners to experts. Unlike many academic mixers, this event will not focus on a department or discipline—rather, a broad set of activities—so this is a great opportunity to leave one’s silo and meet colleagues and potential collaborators. And enjoy some refreshments!</p>

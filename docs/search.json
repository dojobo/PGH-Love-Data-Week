    "text": "Love Data Week is an annual time for libraries to showcase, discuss, and celebrate working with data.\n2023 is the Year of Emotional Well-Being at Pitt, and this year we want to emphasize healthy learning and professional development: it’s not about being the perfect coder or making the perfect plot, but about starting where you are, and doing what you can with what you have.\nIn that spirit, we’re offering accessible workshops, artistic expressions with data, and informative talks about data work.\nWhen is Love Data Week at Pitt? Well, International Love Data Week is always the week of Valentine’s Day, but our events at Pitt can’t all fit into one week! Our dates locally are February 9–17 & 23, 2023.\nHow to register? There is no registration for the entire series; each event has its own registration link, so pick and choose as you like! All events are free and open to the Pitt and UPMC communities.\nThe planned mixers have been cancelled due to low registration."

In the past, this genre was created exclusively in the studio. Recently, a floodgate of new hardware interfaces for musical expression gave laptop performers newer and better ways to control software with hardware on stage in front of an audience.

My presentation will demonstrate three real-time approaches to manipulating computer data to produce electronic sounds. I will begin with a demonstration using the laptop as an instrument using the programming environment Max/MSP.

In reality, data science is like everything else – completed in a series of steps, inevitably beginning with the first. Nobody begins anything as an expert – this talk will provide some tools for starting where you are.\nLed by two recent data science beginners, this talk will open with an introduction to getting to know your data. Understanding the structure and scope of your data is an essential first step in working with it successfully. We will use an open-source tool called Open Refine to review a data set and understand the many ways in which data can be messy.\nAnother important step in building data science skills is working from existing code. Far from being a lazy shortcut, code reuse is standard practice in data science. We will share some tips for getting the most out of code samples, including finding reusable code, interpreting functions and adapting existing code to the needs of your project.\nHaving recently completed data science fellowships, the two presenters each began their fellowship work as newcomers to data science. By the end, each had completed projects that advanced analysis across federal funding and research data management agencies.

The All of Us Researchers Workbench is a cloud-based platform where researchers can access AoURP-generated data. This short one-hour workshop will focus on AoU data structure, onboarding, cloud computing, example applications, and the scope of research questions. \n\nOnline\n📅 Tuesday, Feb. 14    🕐 1–2pm\n✏️ Register here\n\n\n\nQuantum Nanowires: A case study on reproducibility in natural sciences\nDr. Sergey Frolov, Department of Physics & Astronomy\nHosted by the Center for Philosophy of Science\n\nThree years ago, I and a friend found major problems in a Nature paper in my field. The paper has since been retracted, along with another Nature paper. Several more are recommended for retraction, are under expressions of concern or pending corrections. I tangled with colleagues, including close friends, university administrators, journal editors, and funding managers. I learned many lessons, mostly about how slow things go, how many things don’t work and how far is the culture and attitudes around unreliable research from where it needs to be. Perhaps the most eye-opening has been that the reproducibility crisis is in full swing in natural sciences, which traditionally consider themselves insulated due to their perceived rigor. I began formulating what changes are desired, some are very technocratic – such as total data sharing, and post-publication peer review. Some are harder, like changing the incentives, the business models and the employment habits. Still, without taking care of the scientific process itself, we cannot put much value on the science it produces.\n\nAt CL 1119 and online (YouTube)\n📅 Friday, Feb. 10    🕛 12–1:30pm\n✏️ More info\n\n\n\nArt + Data\nDr. Chelsea Gunn, Department of Information Culture and Data Stewardship,\n& Liz Monk, Center for Social and Urban Research\n\nData is collected and shared in a myriad of ways and sometimes can be complicated or difficult to understand (especially in a presentation where the slide goes too quickly and the numbers are small and you are in the back of the room).

Using software developed by Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute), the world leader in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), participants will learn how to produce several types of thematic maps using ArcGIS Online (AGOL) and ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World (Living Atlas). AGOL is a piece of web-based mapping software that allows users to produce a variety interactive web-based thematic maps, perform spatial analyses and visualize data. The Living Atlas of the World is a curated collection of geospatial data from around the world. Easily accessible, the Living Atlas allows individuals to find and manipulate geospatial data using Esri software.

Organizations have a need for the skills that the students want to offer, however infrastructure is needed to connect the two. For example, students may need help translating issues on the ground into the language of their discipline, design projects that fit into their academic schedule or to find peers and mentors to work together with. This talk will present one example of such an infrastructure at CAASI Grief to Action and show how it was leveraged to create the Allegheny County Policing Project.\nAudiences: Undergraduate students; Teaching faculty and instructors\n\nOnline\n📅 Monday, Feb. 13    🕐 1–1:30pm\n✏️ Register here\n\n\n\nGestural Music-Making and Wireless Data Manipulation in Electronic Music\nBrian Riordan, School of Music\n\nReal-time electronic music presents a fascinating opportunity for manipulating data to produce different sonic results.
